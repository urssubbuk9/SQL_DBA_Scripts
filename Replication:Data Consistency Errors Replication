This can be used as a guide but it is in development
Errors
2601 Cannot insert duplicate key row in object '%.*ls' with unique index '%.*ls'
20598 The row was not found at the Subscriber when applying the replicated command.
2627 Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK__'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.'.
1. Using below command also we can get error details
Use Distribution
go

select * from dbo.MSrepl_errors where error_code in ('2601','2627','20598')

2. Now Copy "Sequence Number" form the error and use in below query
SELECT  art.publisher_id ,
        art.publisher_db ,
        db.id as publisher_database_id ,
        art.article ,
        art.article_id  ,
        art.destination_object  ,
        art.source_owner  ,
        art.source_object,
        command_id
FROM    distribution.dbo.MSarticles AS art
        JOIN distribution.dbo.MSrepl_commands AS com
        ON art.Article_id = com.Article_id
	join distribution.dbo.MSpublisher_databases as db
	on art.publisher_db = db.publisher_db
WHERE   com.xact_seqno = <?>

3. The above query will return publisher_database_id and article_id which we will use in below query
EXEC distribution.dbo.sp_browsereplcmds
     @xact_seqno_start = '<?>' ,
     @xact_seqno_end = '<?>' ,
     @publisher_database_id = <?> ,
     @article_id = <?> ,
     @command_id = <?>

It above query will return Command value, this is the transaction which is being complained about.
