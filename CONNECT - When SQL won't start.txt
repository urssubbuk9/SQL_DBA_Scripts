# Starting and connecting to SQL Server when it won't start
# First check the SQL Server error log file - can access even when SQL is off.

To start SQL when the system databases are unaccessible (for example model or tempdb cannot start) find the directory that holds the SQL exe by looking within services.msc,
right clicking on the SQL service for the instance you want and Properies> General has the location. In command prompt cd to that location, usually "Binn" and run:

    sqlservr.exe -s<InstanceName> -T3608 -T3609

#Note there is no space after s

3608	Recovers master database only. Skips automatic recovery (at startup) for all databases except the master database.
3609	Skips the creation of the tempdb database at startup. Use this trace flag if the tempdb database is problematic or problems exist in the model database.
-c	Start as a console and not service.
-f	Minimal configuration mode.

Once SQL Server has started, open a new (additional) command prompt and use the below:

    SQLCMD -S server\instance -E
        For example
    SQLCMD -S GBRFIN01N\FIN -E

#Note the capital S, which is case sensitive
Adding a -A starts it with a Dedicated Admin connection

Congratulations, you're now connected to SQL Server via SQLCMD. After every command you'll need to type GO and commands can be multi-line.
You can attempt to bring up the problem database from here, for example:
        RESTORE DATABASE MODEL WITH RECOVERY.
That may work or may give you a more helpful error message.
